          <p>Our pizza style is American â€“ light crisp bases with both traditional and contemporary topping combinations. We also have several non-pizza options including chicken wings, main course salads, roasted Irish half-chicken and more.</p>

          <p>Our signature pizzas are baked in our Woodstone pizza oven which was imported for us from Washington State in the USA. These pizza ovens are regarded as the best in the world and we believe help us create outstanding pizza bases.</p>
