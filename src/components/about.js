          <p>Our pizza style is American â€“ light crisp bases with both traditional and contemporary topping combinations. We also have several non-pizza options including chicken wings, main course salads, roasted Irish half-chicken and more.</p>

          <p>Our signature pizzas are baked in our <strong>Woodstone pizza oven</strong> which was imported for us from <strong>Washington State</strong> in the USA. These pizza ovens are regarded as the best in the world and we believe help us create outstanding pizza bases.</p>
